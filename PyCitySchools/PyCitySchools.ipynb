    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of testing scores in the areas of Maths and Reading is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Assessment:**\n",
    "Based on the assessment of 39,170 students from 15 different schools, the initial findings reveal that the average score for math was 70.34, while for reading it was 69.98. Additionally, the overall passing rate for math was 86.08%, and for reading it was 84.43%. Finally, 72.81% of the students were able to pass both tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**School Performance:**\n",
    "Griffin High School has the highest overall passing rate at 81.34%, exceeding the average by almost 9%. In contrast, Hernandez High School exhibited the lowest performance, with an overall passing rate of only 66.36%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Scores by Year:**\n",
    "The results for the average score on both Maths and Reading by year do not show any significant differences between them. The test scores by year are all very close to their respective global average without any sign of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget per Capita:**\n",
    "Surprisingly, the best overall passing results when looking at the budget per capita do not belong to the students in which more budget is spent ($645-680) but rather to the $585-630 spending range followed by the lowest spending range, with results of 79.88% and 76.72% respectively. Furthermore, the schools with the fewest number of students (<1,000) presented a considerably much higher overall passing rate than the large schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of School:**\n",
    "Lastly, a final view of the overall test scores by type of school reveals that Independent Schools have much higher results in both Maths and Reading Test Scores than Government Schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:**\n",
    "From the above analysis, two important conclusions can be drawn:\n",
    "* In average, Maths Test Scores are slightly higher than Reading Test Scores.\n",
    "* Independent Schools have much better test scores overall and by subject than Government Schools, with 3 Independent Schools in the Top 5 performing Schools, and 4 Government Schools in the Bottom 5 performing Schools."
